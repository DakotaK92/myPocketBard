THIS IS MY TAKE OF THE COMPANY POCKETBARD'S WEBSITE! I WAS SUPPLIED ART FROM THE DESIGNER TO CREATE MY OWN DESIGN PAGE. CHECK OUT POCKETBARD FOR ALL THINGS DnD, AND ENJOY!

## myPocketBard
This is a music providing company that is designed to be play music in intense moments in your campaign. You can increase intensity or decrease it depending on what you need! You can also change the type of music, if you want to change a western you cyberpunk, you can do that seemlessly. This is my take on a company website that I felt needed some love and for me to test out my skills
